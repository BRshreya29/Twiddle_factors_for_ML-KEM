# Area-Efficient Twiddle Factor Design for NTT/INTT Hardware

This repository contains the Verilog/HDL implementation of an **area-efficient twiddle factor computation unit** for the **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)** and **Inverse NTT (INTT)** used in lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (e.g., **CRYSTALS-Kyber**).  
The design significantly reduces **on-chip memory utilization** while maintaining efficient computation.

## Project Overview
- **Problem:**  
  Traditional NTT/INTT implementations rely on storing large sets of precomputed *twiddle factors* in ROM, which increases hardware resource usage.  
- **Solution:**  
  We propose **two-fold** and **four-fold** twiddle factor computation techniques that exploit mathematical relationships between factors to reduce ROM size.  
- **Impact:**  
  Achieves **40.16% (two-fold)** and **56.69% (four-fold)** memory savings compared to conventional approaches, without increasing latency.

## Features
- Supports **radix-4 NTT/INTT butterfly architecture**.  
- Implements **two-fold** and **four-fold computation units**.  
- Reduces precomputed twiddle factors from **254 ‚Üí 148 (+4)** (two-fold) and **254 ‚Üí 106 (+4)** (four-fold).  
- Verified using **Xilinx Vivado** simulations and synthesized on **Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA**.  
- Integrates with **Kyber Digital Signal Processing (K-DSP)** as the modular multiplication unit.
